I'm a PhD student at the [Autonomous Controls Lab](https://depts.washington.edu/uwacl/) in the University of Washington, Seattle. I'm advised by [Prof. Behçet Açıkmeşe](https://www.aa.washington.edu/facultyfinder/behcet-acikmese). My research focuses on optimization-based trajectory generation for robotics, with an emphasis on real-time performance and resilience.
